## Development server
In order to deploy a local version of the project you must:
- Download the project from github
- Run npm install at the root of the project
- Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Project status
The project is currently in its first demo, which means that it is already functional. But I keep adding design improvements and optimizations to improve it
