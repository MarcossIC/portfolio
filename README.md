The project is developed in Angular 16 and uses these technologies:

<p user-select="none" align="left">
   <a href="#" rel="noreferrer"> <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=angular,ts,css,html,tailwind"/> </a>
</p>

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Development server

In order to deploy a local version of the project you must:

- Download the project from github
- Run `npm i` or `pnpm i` at the root of the project
- Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
  The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## üí™ Project status

The project is currently in its second version, in this version a considerable design change has occurred. The way the projects were displayed has been improved, the pages have been simplified so that all the content is in just one. The content has been compressed into an "about" section using a currently popular design element the "bento". I hope you like it :D
